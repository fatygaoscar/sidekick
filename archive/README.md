# Archive Policy

This folder stores non-active project artifacts moved out of the repo root to keep the working surface clean.

## Structure

- `archive/markdown/YYYY-MM-DD/` for archived root markdown docs.
- Keep original filenames when moving files.

## What to Archive

Archive files that are no longer part of active operations, such as:
- one-off handoff notes
- planning scratch docs
- temporary helper guides

## What to Keep at Repo Root

Only active core docs should remain at root:
- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

## Notes

- Do not archive files that are part of active build/test/runtime workflows.
- Prefer moving files (not deleting) unless explicitly requested.
